Everytime i use the LaZagne project to extraxt stored passwords in a system i get overwhelmed by the sheer number of passwords in the output. And for that reason i created Clown. By running CLOWN which directly invokes the LaZagne project, you get LaZagne's output. Only this time the output will be forwared to your email for further assessment. THIS PROJECT IS MEANT FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.
